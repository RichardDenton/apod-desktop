# apod-desktop
A simple Python script for downloading the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day from http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html and setting it as the desktop background.

The script has so far been tested on Linux Mint 18 with a Cinnamon desktop.

This script requires BeautifulSoup and lxml to run.
